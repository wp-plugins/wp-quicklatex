Tested up to: 4.1

Advanced LaTeX plugin. Easy exchange with offline papers. Allows custom preamble, TikZ and other packages. Zoom-independent visual quality (SVG).

== Description ==

Insert formulas & graphics in the posts and comments using native LaTeX shorthands directly in the text. Inline formulas, displayed equations auto-numbering, labeling and referencing, AMS-LaTeX, <code>TikZ</code>, custom LaTeX preamble. No LaTeX installation required. Easily customizable using UI page. Actively developed and maintained. Visit <a href="http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/">QuickLaTeX homepage</a> for more info. 

1.  Standard LaTeX expressions can be cut and pasted directly into WordPress posts, pages, and comments; display environments require no enclosures, other expressions require only a surrounding <code>$..$</code> or <code>\[..\]</code>.  No need for enclosing tags <code>[latex] ... [/latex]</code>.
1.  Correct vertical positioning of inline formulas relative to baseline of surrounding text. Say “NO” to jumpy equations produced by other plugins!
1.  SVG vector graphics support, so that formulas are crisp regardless of scaling in browser.
1.  (AMS)LaTeX displayed math environments support: <code>equation, align, gather, multiline, flalign, alignat,</code> etc.
1.  Automatic numbering of displayed equations. Override autonumbering with `\tag{}` LaTeX command.
1.  Equation hyper-referencing by standard LaTeX rules with `\label{}`, `\ref{}`.
1.  Custom LaTeX document preamble, allowing added <code>\usepackage{}</code> and <code>\newcommand{}</code>.
1.  <code>TikZ</code> and <code>pgfplots</code> graphics package support.
1.  Preview formulas in comments before publishing. Additionally [AJAX Comment Preview](http://blogwaffe.com/ajax-comment-preview/) plugin should be installed to enable this feature.
1.  Meaningful error messages for mistakes in LaTeX code.
1.  Precise font properties tuning: <code>size, text and background color</code>. 
1.  Easy style customization using UI or CSS file.
1.  No LaTeX installation is required. 
1.	QuickLaTeX.com automatically provides formula images, which are then cached on user's server.
1.  Administrative settings page for setting global parameters; AJAX-ified.

Just place LaTeX math expressions into your text and enable QuickLaTeX on the page by <code>[latexpage]</code> command.
WP QuickLaTeX will convert them to high-quality images and embed into post. Inline formulas will be properly aligned with the text.
Displayed equations will be auto-numbered by LaTeX rules.
To see plugin in action please visit math-pages on my blog, e.g. [Central Differences](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/numerical-methods/numerical-derivative/central-differences/),
[Cubature formulas for the unit disk](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/numerical-methods/numerical-integration/cubature-formulas-for-the-unit-disk/), [Smooth noise robust differentiators](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/numerical-methods/numerical-derivative/smooth-low-noise-differentiators/), etc.

== Installation ==

WP QuickLaTeX is based on the free web service [QuickLaTeX.com](http://quicklatex.com/) and doesn't require 
LaTeX to be installed on user's server or hosting account. Just install the plugin and you are good to go.

1. Download WP QuickLaTeX plug-in.
2. Unzip the plugin file and upload its content to `wp-content/plugins` folder of your blog.
3. Activate WP-QuickLaTeX through the 'Plugins' menu in Wordpress.
4. Create `ql-cache` folder in `wp-content` and make it writable (by `chmod 777` or through File Manager in cPanel).

WP-QuickLaTeX stores expression images in the folder `wp-content/ql-cache`, greatly boosting performance of your site. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add LaTeX to my posts? =
There are three possible ways:

* Place <code>[latexpage]</code> somewhere on the page, post, or comment. Place LaTeX expression surrounded by <code>$..$, \[..\]</code> or a display environment <code>\begin(equation}..\end{equation}</code> (or <code>align, gather, multiline, flalign, alignat</code>). 
* Enable 'Use LaTeX Syntax Sitewide'; then it is not necessary to place <code>[latexpage]</code>.
* Wrap formulas with <code>[latex] ... [/latex]</code> (this gives compatibility with previously-written "legacy" pages). 

In any case plugin will do automatic/custom equation numbering based on LaTeX rules.  
Check [plugin home page](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/) for more information on features, examples, tips & tricks.

= How can I send bug reports or request new feature? =

Please use comments on the plugin's web page [WP-QuickLaTeX](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/).
I'll do my best to help you.

Please allow ample time for this process.
